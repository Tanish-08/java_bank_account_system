Java Bank Account System

This Java program simulates a basic bank account system with the following features:

Creates a savings account with account number, account holder name, initial balance, and interest rate
Allows users to deposit, withdraw, check balance, add interest, and display account information
Uses an abstract class BankAccount and a concrete class SavingsAccount to implement the account functionality
Uses a Scanner to get user input and a while loop to continuously prompt the user for actions until they choose to exit.
